near-blank-project Smart Contract
==================

A [smart contract] written in [Rust] for an app initialized with [create-near-app]


Quick Start
===========

Before you compile this code, you will need to install Rust with [correct target]


Exploring The Code
==================

1. The main smart contract code lives in `src/lib.rs`. You can compile it with
   the `./compile` script.
2. Tests: You can run smart contract tests with the `./test` script. This runs
   standard Rust tests using [cargo] with a `--nocapture` flag so that you
   can see any debug info you print to the console.
