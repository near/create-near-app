/*
 * This is an example of an AssemblyScript smart contract with two simple,
 * symmetric functions:
 *
 * 1. setGreeting: accepts a greeting, such as "howdy", and records it for the
 *    user (account_id) who sent the request
 * 2. getGreeting: accepts an account_id and returns the greeting saved for it,
 *    defaulting to "Hello"
 *
