<<\\DOC_END

This sample hook safeguards topic branches that have been
published from being rewound.

The workflow assumed here is:

 * Once a topic branch forks from "master", "master" is never
   merged into it again (either directly or indirectly).

 * Once a topic branch is fully cooked and merged into "master",
   it is deleted.  If you need to build on top of it to correct
   earlier mistakes, a new topic branch is created by forking at
   the tip of the "master".  This is not strictly necessary, but
   it makes it easier to keep your history simple.

 * Whenever you need to test or publish your changes to topic
   branches, merge them into "next" branch.

The script, being an example, hardcodes the publish branch name
to be "next", but it is trivial to make it configurable via
$GIT_DIR/config mechanism.

With this workflow, you would want to know:

(1) ... if a topic branch has ever been merged to "next".  Young
    topic branches can have stupid mistakes you would rather
    clean up before publishing, and things that have not been
    merged into other branches can be easily rebased without
    affecting other people.  But once it is published, you would
    not want to rewind it.

(2) ... if a topic branch has been fully merged to "master".
    Then you can delete it.  More importantly, you should not
    build on top of it -- other people may already want to
    change things related to the topic as patches against your
    "master", so if you need further changes, it is better to
    fork the topic (perhaps with the same name) afresh from the
    tip of "master".

Let's look at this example:

		   o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o "next"
		  /       /           /           /
		 /   a---a---b A     /           /
		/   /               /           /
	       /   /   c---c---c---c B         /
	      /   /   /             \\         /
	     /   /   /   b---b C     \\       /
	    /   /   /   /             \\     /
    ---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o "master"


A, B and C are topic branches.

 * A has one fix since it was merged up to "next".

 * B has finished.  It has been fully merged up to "master" and "next",
   and is ready to be deleted.

 * C has not merged to "next" at all.

We would want to allow C to be rebased, refuse A, and encourage
B to be deleted.

To compute (1):

	git rev-list ^master ^topic next
	git rev-list ^master        next

	if these match, topic has not merged in next at all.

To compute (2):

	git rev-list master..topic

	if this is empty, it is fully merged to "master".

# An example hook script to update a checked-out tree on a git push.
#
# This hook is invoked by git-receive-pack(1) when it reacts to git
# push and updates reference(s) in its repository, and when the push
# tries to update the branch that is currently checked out and the
# receive.denyCurrentBranch configuration variable is set to
# updateInstead.
#
# By default, such a push is refused if the working tree and the index
# of the remote repository has any difference from the currently
# checked out commit; when both the working tree and the index match
# the current commit, they are updated to match the newly pushed tip
# of the branch. This hook is to be used to override the default
# behaviour; however the code below reimplements the default behaviour
# as a starting point for convenient modification.
#
# The hook receives the commit with which the tip of the current
# branch is going to be updated:
commit=$1

# It can exit with a non-zero status to refuse the push (when it does
# so, it must not modify the index or the working tree).
die () {

# Or it can make any necessary changes to the working tree and to the
# index to bring them to the desired state when the tip of the current
# branch is updated to the new commit, and exit with a zero status.
#
# For example, the hook can simply run git read-tree -u -m HEAD "$1"
# in order to emulate git fetch that is run in the reverse direction
# with git push, as the two-tree form of git read-tree -u -m is
# essentially the same as git switch or git checkout that switches
# branches while keeping the local changes in the working tree that do
# not interfere with the difference between the branches.

# The below is a more-or-less exact translation to shell of the C code
# for the default behaviour for git's push-to-checkout hook defined in

# An example hook script to block unannotated tags from entering.
# Called by "git receive-pack" with arguments: refname sha1-old sha1-new
#
# To enable this hook, rename this file to "update".
#
# Config
# ------
# hooks.allowunannotated
#   This boolean sets whether unannotated tags will be allowed into the
#   repository.  By default they won't be.
# hooks.allowdeletetag
#   This boolean sets whether deleting tags will be allowed in the
#   repository.  By default they won't be.
# hooks.allowmodifytag
#   This boolean sets whether a tag may be modified after creation. By default
#   it won't be.
# hooks.allowdeletebranch
#   This boolean sets whether deleting branches will be allowed in the
#   repository.  By default they won't be.
# hooks.denycreatebranch
#   This boolean sets whether remotely creating branches will be denied
#   in the repository.  By default this is allowed.

  "# Hello NEAR Contract

The smart contract exposes two methods to enable storing and retrieving a greeting in the NEAR network.

\`\`\`ts
@NearBindgen({})
class HelloNear {
  greeting: string = "Hello";

  @view // This method is read-only and can be called for free
  get_greeting(): string {
    return this.greeting;
  }

  @call // This method changes the state, for which it cost gas
  set_greeting({ greeting }: { greeting: string }): void {
    // Record a log permanently to the blockchain!
    near.log(\`Saving greeting \${greeting}\`);
    this.greeting = greeting;
  }
}
\`\`\`

<br />

# Quickstart

1. Make sure you have installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) >= 16.
2. Install the [\`NEAR CLI\`](https://github.com/near/near-cli#setup)

<br />

## 1. Build and Test the Contract
You can automatically compile and test the contract by running:

\`\`\`bash
npm run build
\`\`\`

<br />

## 2. Create an Account and Deploy the Contract
You can create a new account and deploy the contract by running:

\`\`\`bash
near create-account <your-account.testnet> --useFaucet
near deploy <your-account.testnet> build/release/hello_near.wasm
\`\`\`

<br />


## 3. Retrieve the Greeting

\`get_greeting\` is a read-only method (aka \`view\` method).

\`View\` methods can be called for **free** by anyone, even people **without a NEAR account**!

\`\`\`bash
# Use near-cli to get the greeting
near view <your-account.testnet> get_greeting
\`\`\`

<br />

## 4. Store a New Greeting
\`set_greeting\` changes the contract's state, for which it is a \`call\` method.

\`Call\` methods can only be invoked using a NEAR account, since the account needs to pay GAS for the transaction.

\`\`\`bash
# Use near-cli to set a new greeting
near call <your-account.testnet> set_greeting '{"greeting":"howdy"}' --accountId <your-account.testnet>
\`\`\`

**Tip:** If you would like to call \`set_greeting\` using another account, first login into NEAR using:

\`\`\`bash
# Use near-cli to login your NEAR account
near login
\`\`\`

and then use the logged account to sign the transaction: \`--accountId <another-account>\`.",

  "This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [\`create-next-app\`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

\`\`\`bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
\`\`\`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying \`app/page.js\`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [\`next/font\`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

\`\`\`bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
\`\`\`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying \`app/page.js\`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [\`next/font\`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
